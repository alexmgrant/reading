# Prioritize Regularly

- The right focus can significantly accelerate a product's growth rate.
- Always more tasks to do than you have time for.
- **Don't try to get everything done.** Focus on what produces the highest value.

___

**Partitioning of activities based on urgency and importance.**

| | Ugent | Not Urgent |
| :--- | :--- | :---|
| **Important** | **1** <br><br> Crises <br> Pressing Issues <br> Deadlines |**2** <br><br> Planning and prevention <br> Building Relationships <br> New opportunities <br> Personal development |
| **Not Important** | **3** <br><br> Interruptions <br> Most meetings <br> Most emails and calls | **4** <br><br> Surfing the web <br> Busy work <br> Time wasters |

## Limit the Amount of Work in Progress

- **Work on what directly leads to value.**
  - Don’t try to do everything. Regularly ask yourself if there’s something higher-leverage that you could be doing.
- Competing priorities divide the team, and momentum on any one activity slows down
- Work on the important and non-urgent. Prioritize long-term investments that increase your effectiveness, even if they don’t have a deadline.
- Reduce context switches. 
  - Protect large blocks of time for your creative output, and limit the number of ongoing projects so that you don’t spend your cognitive energy actively juggling tasks.

## Fight Procrastination with If-Then Plans

- Binding an intention to do something to a trigger significantly increases the likelihood that you’ll get it done.
  - ex: If after 3pm work on long standing bug.
  - ex: If drinking morning coffee read a chapter from {Current Book}
  
## Make prioritization a habit. 
- Experiment to figure out a good workflow. Prioritize regularly, and it’ll get easier to focus on and complete your highest-leverage activities.
