## Notes

### Weak or Strong Teams

**Weak teams**
Product domain is owned by an individual who brings together a team to execute.

**Strong teams**
Product domain is owned by a team independent of who is on the team.

### Staff Engineer Archetypes

> Focus on work that energizes you

1. Tech Lead
1. Architect
1. Solver
1. Right Hand

### What Does a Staff Engineer do?

**Speak for the companies' technology**

> A part time product manager for a companies' technology

- pragmatic
- deliberate
- focus on long-term > individual decisions as a make-or-break crisis

Setting technical direction is about understanding and solving the needs of the organization over prioritizing technology you're interested in. This can mean passing high profile/exciting work to someone who may benefit more from it than you.

> The quality of an architect's decisions degrade the further they get from doing real work on real code in the real process

### Create Space for Others

> “deliberately create space for the team around you”

One of the best measures of your long-term success is that the organization around you increasingly benefits from, **but doesn’t rely upon**, your contributions.

- Shift your contribution towards asking questions
- If someone in the meeting isn’t participating, pull them into the discussion, one person at a time
- Be the one to take notes
- If someone’s missing from the discussion who should be there, pull them into the next occurrence of the meeting


### Takeaways

Tasks that aid in situational awareness
- build passive internal customer and business context
  - read PR's across org
  - read tech specs & proposals that are public
  - attend/watch internal presentations focused on relavent product areas 

Write it down / write a lot
> If you can't capture a problem statement or idea in a coherent, concise paragraph you need to do more research and you'll have a rough time trying to convince others

Make your managers job easier
- bring them multiple recommendations / suggestions for solutions and ask for feedback

Think intentionally about creating opportunities for other engineers you work with to grow their skills and get access to visibility

Build Relationships early

For advocacy Remind ourselves what the pain points are that everyone felt that led to the change/meeting/feature/project
